# Welcome to Hoot

**Hoot** is a social app designed to spark meaningful conversations with friends around prompts.

Hoot allows friends to submit and vote on prompts. Three times a week, everyone answers the same prompt question.
This creates a shared experience, as you see how your friends answered the question. Friends can reply to each others responses.
It's a simple yet powerful way to engage with friends and family.
